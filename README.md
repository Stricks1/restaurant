# Restaurant

On this project I applied the concepts of Webpack and JS DOM manipulation to build all content on an empty HTML, it is a responsive front end design for a restaurant page. 
The project shows a restaurant with three tabs to navigate, Home, Menu - with some dishes - and a Contact tab with a form. 
On the menu, it is possible to rate the dishes from 1 to 5 stars.
